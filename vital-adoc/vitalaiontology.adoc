== Vital AI Ontology

Vital AI provides a base ontology which is used throughout the Vital AI Platform.  An application extends this ontology to create the classes and properties required for that specific application.

The Vital AI Ontology is split into the "CORE" ontology and the main Vital AI Ontology.

The Vital CORE ontology defines top level classes and properties.

The top level CORE classes are:

1. VITAL_Node
1. VITAL_Edge
1. VITAL_HyperNode
1. VITAL_HyperEdge

Each of the instances of these classes must have a unique URI.  Each of the instances of these classes may have any number of properties.

The main Vital AI Ontology includes classes such as "VITAL_Document" and "VITAL_User" which may be used in a typical application.  These examples extend the VITAL_Node class.  Another example class in the main Vital AI Ontology is "VITAL_Likes" which extends the VITAL_Edge class.  Thus, a "like" relationship between a User and a Document can be modeled with an instance of the "VITAL_Likes" edge with the User as the source and the Document as the destination of this directed edge.

An application such as a movie recommendation application would create classes such as "Movie" which would extend VITAL_Node to model the data required for that application.

The VitalSigns component uses the CORE and main ontology and the application-specific ontologies to map and bind data across the different platform components.
