=== VitalSigns Overview

VitalSigns is a component of the Vital AI Platform. VitalSigns allows a data model  
to be defined in an ontology using OWL and creates bindings for the data model in  
the various components of the Vital AI Platform. This allows the mobile or web  
application developer to be using the same data model as the data scientist running  
jobs in Hadoop. The data model is seamlessly used throughout the application,   
eliminating painful data transformations and a host of data integration issues.

=== Installing VitalSigns
http://github.com/vital-ai/vital-documentation/wiki/Installing-VDK[Installing the Vital AI Development Kit (VDK), window="http://github.com/vital-ai/vital-documentation/wiki/Installing-VDK"], will enable you to use VitalSigns.  
Since VitalSigns commands are run from a Linux or Unix shell, Microsoft Windows   
users will also need to https://cygwin.com/install.html[install Cygwin, window="https://cygwin.com/install.html"], a Unix-like environment and command-line  
interface for Microsoft Windows.

=== VitalSigns Commands

*General Usage*

Vital Signs commands have the following usage pattern:

[source, groovy]
----
vitalsigns <command> [options] 
----

where command is one of (<<help,help>>, <<generate,generate>>, <<version,version>>, <<status,status>>, <<listindividuals,listindividuals>>,   
<<mergeindividuals,mergeindividuals>>, <<removeindividuals,removeindividuals>>, <<diff,diff>>, <<merge,merge>>, <<normalizeontology,normalizeontology>>,    
<<validateontology,validateontology>>, <<verify,verify>>, <<gitdisenable,gitdisenable>>, <<gitdisable,gitdisable>>, <<upversion,upversion>>, <<downversion,downversion>>, <<checkin,checkin>>,  
<<purge,purge>>, <<gitpostmerge,gitpostmerge>>, <<mergestatus,mergestatus>>, <<mergetool,mergetool>>, and <<gitjarmerge,gitjarmerge>>)
    

[[help]]*help*

To obtain a summary of VitalSigns commands and their usage options enter:  

[source, groovy]
----
vitalsigns help
----

[[generate]]*generate*

1. To generate a domain jar from a domain ontology enter:

[source, groovy]
----
vitalsigns generate -o | --ontology <input ontology> -p | --package <package> -t groovy
----
    
where _input ontology_ is either the file name or path to the input  
ontology and _package_ is the name of your application's package (ie. com.your-domain.your-app-name). The -p | --package option is required only if your ontology does not have a default pacakge property. By default, the domain jar will be written at $VITAL_HOME/domain-groovy-jar/app.version.jar.  
    
To supply the jar file with an alternative name or to write it to a location other than default ($VITAL_HOME/domain-groovy-jar/), enter:
    
[source, groovy]
----
vitalsigns generate -j | --jar <output jar> -o | --ontology <input ontology> -p | --package <package> -t groovy
----

where _output jar_ is the path to the output jar.  
    
Note: To force vitalsigns to generate a new version of the jar file even if   
no changes have been made to the ontology, specify the -or | --override option. 

[start=2]
1. To generate a json schema from a domain ontology enter:

[source, groovy]  
----
vitalsigns generate -o | --ontology <input ontology> -or | --override -p | --package <package> -t json
----

where _input ontology_ is either the file name or path to the input ontology and _package_ is the name of your application's package (i.e. com.your-domain.your-app-name). The -p | --package option is required only if your ontology does not have a default package property. By default, the json schema will be written at $VITAL_HOME/domain-json/app.version.json.    
    
To supply the json schema with an alternative name or to write it to a location other than default ($VITAL_HOME/domain-json/), enter:
    
[source, groovy] 
----
vitalsigns generate -js | --json-schema <output json> -o | --ontology <input ontology> -p | --package <package> -t groovy
----
    
where _output json_ is the path to the output json schema.
    
To force vitalsigns to generate a new version of the json schema even if no changes have been made to the ontology or a json schema already exists, specify the -or | --override option.
   
[[version]]*version*



[[status]]*status*


[[listindividuals]]*listindividuals*

To list the individuals or "ground level" objects of an ontology enter:

[source, groovy]
----
vitalsigns listindividuals -o <input ontology>
----

where _input ontology_ is either the file name or path to an input ontology  
(either external or within $VITAL_HOME).    

For example, entering the command:

[source, groovy]
----
vitalsigns listindividuals -o vital-samples-0.1.0.owl
----

will produce the following output:

image::list-individuals-vital-samples.png[]

[[mergeindividuals]]*mergeindividuals*

[[removeindividuals]]*removeindividuals*

To remove all of an ontology's individuals or "ground level" objects enter:  

[source, groovy]
----
vitalsigns removeindividuals -i <ontology file path> - o <ontology file name>
---- 
where _ontology file path_ is the path to the ontology from which the individuals   
are to be removed and _ontology file name_ is the name of that ontolology in  
$VITAL_HOME/domain-ontology/. 

When removeindividuals executes, the current version of the ontology is archived  
and a new onotlogy with the ontology's individuals removed is generated.  

If git is enabled, all changes are added to the staging area.   

[[diff]]*diff*
 

[[merge]]*merge*

To merge two ontologies enter:

[source, groovy]
----
vitalsigns merge -m | --merging <merging ontology> -o | --ont <input ontology>
----

where _merging ontology_ is either the  file name or path to the merging  
ontology (external or within $VITAL_HOME) and _input ontology_ is either the   
file name or path to the input ontology within $VITAL_HOME.

When merge executes, the current version of the  input ontology is archived and a  
new higher-numbered version of the ontology with merged content is generated.  

Following a merge, it may be nescessary to manually resolve any merge conflicts.  

[[normalizeontology]]*normalizeontology*

[[validateontology]]*validateontology*

The VitalSigns command validateontology checks if an ontology is <<normalizeontology,normalized>>  
and if any comments <<merge,documenting prior merge conflicts>> are present. To validate an   
ontology enter:

[source, groovy]
----
vitalsigns validateontology -o | --ont <input ontology>
---- 
where _input ontology_ is the file name or path to an input ontology.

[[verify]]*verify*

[[gitenable]]*gitenable*

To enable vitalsigns git functionality enter:

[source, groovy]
----
vitalsigns gitenable
----

When vitalsigns git functionality is enabled, vitalsigns will automatically add   
changes in the working directory (made by running vitalsigns commands)  to the   
staging area. You will still need to commit these changes.

[[gitdisenable]]*gitdisenable*

To disable vitalsigns git functionality enter:

[source, groovy]
----
vitalsigns gitenable
----

When vitalsigns git functionality is disabled, vitalsigns will no longer add   
changes in the working directory to the staging area. 

[[upversion]]*upversion*

To increase the patch version of the current ontology enter:  

[source, groovy]
----
vitalsigns upversion -o | --ont <input ontology>
----

where _input ontology_ is either the  file name or path to a domain owl in  
$VITAL_HOME/domain-ontology/.

When upversion executes, the current version of the ontology is archived and a new   
version of the ontology is generated.   

If git is enabled, all changes are added to the staging area.  
  
Note: upversion only modifies the patch number. To modify the major or minor  
version numbers, the ontology must be manually edited.   

[[downversion]]*downversion*

To decrease the patch version of the current ontology enter one of the following:

[source, groovy]
----
vitalsigns downversion -o | --ont <input ontology>
vitalsigns downversion -o | --ont <input ontology> -v | --version <version number>
----

where _input ontology_ is either the file name or path to a domain owl in    
$VITAL_HOME/domain-ontology/ and _version number_ is the optional version  
to be reverted to (n.n.n). If a version is not specified, vitalsigns will use the   
previous version contained in the archive.

When downversion executes, it archives the current version, and generates a new   
higher-numbered version with the content of the older version.

If git is enabled, all changes are added to the staging area.   

Note: downversion only modifies the patch number. To modify the major or minor   
version numbers, the ontology must be manually edited.

[[checkin]]*checkin*

To copy an external ontology into $VITAL_HOME/domain-ontology/, enter:

[source, groovy]
----
vitalsigns checkin -o | --ont <external ontology>
----

where _external ontology_ is the path to an ontology which must not be   
located in $VITAL_HOME. 

If git is enabled, the checked in ontology will be added to the staging area.  

[[purge]]*purge*

To remove an ontology including all archived versions of an ontology as well as  
any domain jars or JSON schema generated from an ontology enter:

[source, groovy]
----
vitalsigns purge -a | --app <prefix>
----

where _prefix_ is the owl and jar files' prefix.
