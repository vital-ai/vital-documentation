== Creating a Grails News Application with Vital AI Platform

As a sample application built with the Vital AI Platform, we provide the Grails News Portal as a "starter" application.  Full source code is available, and it can be a good starting point to build your own application.

The application is built using the Grails Web Framework, and uses the Groovy-based Vital Service Client API.  Clients in other languages are available.

The goal of the application is a simple news portal that displays recent, top, and trending news articles, as well as top and trending news topics and people.

Additional sample applications provide a dashboard to track activity in the application, and a version of the application using Hadoop and "Big Data" functionality to make content recommendations to users.

*This application includes components:*

* Grails Web Framework
* Vital Service Client API
* News Portal Data Model extending the base Vital Data Model
* Natural Language Processing of content to extract Topics and Entities (such as People)
* an open-source NoSQL database for data storage
* a free RSS Feed of content
* the Vital AI Platform

In this guide we will create a simple Grails News application using the Vital AI Platform as a demonstration of using the platform.

We will create a News Portal using the Grails Web Framework for the user interface.

The goal of the application will be to show recent, top, and trending news to the users, as well as show top and trending topics and entities.

Full source code of this example is available, and can be a good start to creating your own application.

A dashboard for this application will also be created, as well as an extended version incorporating Hadoop for content recommendations.

*The components of the application are:*

* Grails Web Framework
* Free RSS feed of news content
* Natural Language Processing to extract topics and entities (such as names of people) from content
* Vital Service Client API
* Vital AI Platform

*The steps of creating the application can be summarized as follows:*

1. Define the data model extending the base data model
1. Create data bindings using `vitalsigns` command
1. Set up the Vital Prime Server with a database for storage
1. Hook up the RSS Feed to the Integrator step with configuration file
1. Hook up the Natural Language Processing step with configuration file
1. Define a VitalFlow to process content with an Integrator step and an NLP step
1. Add a job to process and add new content using the VitalFlow on an ongoing basis
1. Define data buckets in the Vital Prime Server configuration to collect view ("click") information to use for "top" and "trending" functions
1. Define a simple "top" function
1. Define a simple "trending" function
1. Define simple functions for "recent content", "top content", and "trending content"
1. Set up a new application in grails
1. Set up views for the screens such as "home", "view-article", "search-results"
1. Set up sub-views for widgets for "Top Topics", "Top Entities", "Top Articles", "Trending Articles"
1. Set up controllers to call the Vital AI Client API to service the views
1. Call the Vital API Client in view-article to pass "click" information to the platform
1. Run your new grails application powered by Vital AI!
